Generates primes for arbitrary letters

## Demo
300-digit-long prime forming "PRIME" (folded every 30 digits). See Example (ASCII) how to generate.

## Requirements
You need GMP (GNU Multi-Precision Library).
In Cygwin, install libgmp-devel, libgmp, libgmpxx.

## Usage
letter-prime consists of two commands: `gen-string` and `string-prime`.

    gen-string bdf_font AnyString
    gen-string bdf_font -j jis_text
renders `AnyString` or Japanese characters in `jis_text` with the font specified by `bdf_font` and produces 2-dimensional map.

    string-prime [-nodup]
reads 2-dimensional map from stdin and looks for prime numbers which match the given map.
When a prime is found, it is printed.

It also checks twin primes. When `-2 is twin-prime` or `+2 is twin-prime` is printed, previously printed prime -2 or +2 respectively is also prime.

`-nodup` option assigns different digit to each character. (By default, duplicate digits may be assigned to each character.)

Actually `string-prime` accepts any 2-dimensional rectangular map consisted of [0-9a-z] (not necessarily generated by `gen-string`). So you can hand-craft any map such as icons or pictures or whatever. `-nodup` option suits such purpose.

### Example (ASCII)
    ./gen-string bdf_fonts/6x10.bdf PRIME | ./string-prime
This yields the prime in the Demo section.

### Example (Japanese)
You need a JIS-code text and Japanese BDF file. An example of generating such a text is:

    echo Š¿Žš | nkf -j > tmp.txt
Network kanji filter [NKF](https://ja.osdn.net/projects/nkf/releases/p533)
should be installed beforehand.
Or, use any text editor which is capable of JIS-code editing.
In the text file, *NO ASCII CHARACTERS* shall be included.
Then invoke e.g.,

    ./gen-string bdf_fonts/k20m.bdf -j tmp.txt | ./string-prime


## Install
    make all
or

    g++ -O3 gen-string.cpp -o gen-string
    g++ -O3 string-prime.cpp miller-rabin-gmp.cpp -o string-prime -lgmp -lgmpxx



## Notes
### Prime checker
Miller-rabin-gmp.h and Miller-rabin-gmp.cpp are copied from
[The Miller-Rabin probabilistic primality test in C++ w/GMP](https://github.com/cslarsen/miller-rabin) in Github.
Thank you.

### BDF font generation (ASCII)
`gen-string` needs a font in BDF format.
In Cygwin, install "xorg-x11-fonts-misc" package. Then lots of pcf.gz files are
deployed in /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc.

Then obtain [pcf2bdf](https://github.com/ganaware/pcf2bdf) package from Github
and compile. In my environment, I need to commented out the line 20 of pcf2bdf.cc:
`#  define _setmode setmode`
to suppress compilation error.

Then you can directly convert pcf.gz files into bdf file, e.g., 

    pcf2bdf -v -o 4x6.bdf /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc/4x6-ISO8859-1.pcf.gz
`bdf_fonts/[1-9]*.bdf` are generated with such manner.

Other Japanese fonts `bdf_fonts/jis*.bdf, k*.bdf` are public domain fonts.
